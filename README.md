# Project: Can Large Language Models be effective for predicting NBA games?
The objective of this project is to attempt to utilize 3 different Large Language Models, Copilot, Gemini, and Meta AI, in order to maximise accuracy and profit when predicting NBA games. The focus of the project is purely on moneyline bets, or in simpler terms, who wins the game. These models are first asked to make a prediction with no extra data, then asked to make a second prediction with the data from the most recent game between the 2 teams. 

## Background
Sports betting is when people gamble on sporting events, and Artificial intelligence (AI) is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning and decision-making 

### What is there to be gained?
If large language models can be utilized to help people make bets, it can make a lot of profit for people who need it, and it could change their lives. 

#### Project details:
Inlcuded is a csv file with all data, a prompt list featuring the prompts used daily, a python helper function to plot and manipulate data, and the resulting research paper and presentation that was given.

##### Python function:
Note: this python program uses the numpy, matplotlib, and pandas packages. Please use pip or conda if they are not installed on your machine.
The main jobs of this program is to calculate possible winnings for each model approach, manipulate the data, and plot the data on graphs so it can be interpreted. Though the program is simple, it is essential for streamlining the data analysis.
