# Project: Can Large Language Models be effective for predicting NBA games?
The objective of this project is to attempt to utilize 3 different Large Language Models, Copilot, Gemini, and Meta AI, in order to maximise accuracy and profit when predicting NBA games. The focus of the project is purely on moneyline bets, or in simpler terms, who wins the game. These models are first asked to make a prediction with no extra data, then asked to make a second prediction with the data from the most recent game between the 2 teams. 
## Background
Sports betting is when people gamble on sporting events, and Artificial intelligence (AI) is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning and decision-making 
### What is there to be gained?
If large language models can be utilized to help people make bets, it can make a lot of profit for people who need it, and it could change their lives
